# Banyd Bot

## Overview

A fun Telegram bot for a group of friends who regularly visit banya (i.e. sauna). Written in Node.js environment.

## Purpose

It started as an experiment while learning [Telegram Bot API](https://core.telegram.org/bots). After some playing around with "raw" [API](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api), I found a great `npm` package [TeaBot](https://github.com/strikeentco/teabot/tree/master/docs/#telegram-api) and rewrote the app with its help.
